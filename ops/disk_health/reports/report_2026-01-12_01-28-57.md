# External Drive SMART Check Result (WD HDD)

## Summary
- Status: UNSUPPORTED (SMART passthrough unavailable via USB bridge)
- Device: /dev/diskX (external, physical)
- Checked on: 2026-01-12

## Evidence
- Main log: logs/disk_health_<TS>.log
- smartctl outputs: logs/smartctl_<TS>_*.out

## Root Cause
The USB bridge/enclosure does not provide SMART passthrough to the host OS, so smartctl cannot access SMART attributes (temperature, reallocated sectors, pending sectors, etc.).

## Impact
Hardware health metrics cannot be retrieved from this Mac through the current USB connection.

## Mitigations / Next Steps
1) Continue file-level integrity verification (rsync + checksums) and monitor for I/O errors.
2) If SMART is required: switch to a known SMART-passthrough enclosure/bridge or connect via SATA/NAS that can read SMART.
